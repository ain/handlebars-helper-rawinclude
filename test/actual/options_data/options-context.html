<p>Note that even though we&#39;re explicitly defining <code>page</code> and <code>this</code> as the context, since no data is
defined in the page (e.g. YAML front matter) the context will be set to <code>options.data</code> since
<code>options.data</code> is merged into the context directly after page data.</p>
