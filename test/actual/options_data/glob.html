<p>Note that the YAML front matter is &quot;borrowing&quot; data from the <code>site</code> object, which is defined in the Grunt config.</p>
<p>So in this example, <code>{{title}}</code> will yield the same result as <code>{{site.title}}</code>, and <code>{{description}}</code> will
yield the same result as <code>{{site.description}}</code>

  <div class="title">
    This title is from the include YFM (include-yfm.hbs)
  </div>
  <p class="description"> this description is from the options. </p>
</article>

<p>In this example, the context for <code>title</code> should be from the YAML front matter of <code>include-yfm.hbs</code>,
but since no <code>description</code> property exists in the YFM of the include, the context for <code>description</code>
should come from the inheriting page.</p>
